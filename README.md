# Hi, I'm Ana Cifuentes! :smile_cat: :green_heart:

My passion for technology began when I was little, my sister taught me to play with the computer and I discovered everything I could learn to create wonderful things. I was very excited to be able to share everything I was learning, and that is why as an adult I started working as a programming teacher, which inspired me to become a Front-end Developer and create the CHIDAS TECH community that focuses on motivating girls to join STEM areas. Today, through technological tools, I seek to create innovative solutions that can meet the needs of people, and along with it generate an impact so that more women join technology.
